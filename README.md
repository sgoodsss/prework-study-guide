# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for creating this Prework Study Guide Webpage is to assist Beginner Coding Bootcamp students on their prework.  This webpage serves as a study tool for bootcamp students as well as a portfolio of my learning.  This study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes typed in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a randomized suggestion on which topic to study first.
